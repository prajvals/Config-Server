# Config-Server

This is the configuration for the Microservice - Explored Project I made (https://github.com/prajvals/Microservices-Explored)

1. This is the service to bring in the common Configuration of Eureka Client to connect with Eureka Server.

2. Tech Used: **Spring boot**, **Microservices Architecture**, **Eureka Client**, Maven

## Steps to Run 

1. Clone the Repo and Microservices Explained Repo (https://github.com/prajvals/Microservices-Explored)

2. Open the Project in IntellJ idea.

3. Launch the Service Registry Service First as this acts as the Eureka Server.

4. Launch the application.

4. The application connects to the Eureka Server and also hosts the Configuration that is then used by other services to connect to Eureka Server

5. This Service is used to serve Configurations which are required by other services and acts like a common store of all the configurations to be used by other services too.
